Jumping off point for Cisco's backend Forage program
## task
In this task, I worked on the Sextant frontend with the goal of creating a website that displays my public IP and latency information for Pylon. I kept in mind that the requirements for the site may change frequently in the future, so I made an effort to make the site extensible. To achieve this, I created a banner component at the top of the page that displayed the title of the site. I also created an exhibit component that served as a container for different data points, and I made it visually appealing. The first data point that I needed to display was my public IP, which I retrieved using the ipify API. I created a new component to collect and display my public IP addresses, which made an HTTP request to the ipify API as soon as it was mounted and displayed the result to me. I added two instances of this component to the page, one for my ipv4 address and the other for my ipv6 address, both wrapped in the exhibit component. After completing the task, I committed and pushed my changes to GitHub and submitted the link to my repo.
